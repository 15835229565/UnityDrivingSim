# UnityDrivingSim
A driving simulator created for Self Driving Car research.

This repository contains code for a simulator which is being created for the purpose of collecting data for the training of deep neural networks which can be applied to autonomous vehicles.

This work follows from Christopher Hay (Princeton '17) in his paper Training of Vehicle Perception via Stochastic Simulation. 
My work is being conducted under Professor Kornhauser.

The project currently requires the assets EasyRoads3D Pro and Gaia from the Unity asset store. Since I do not own these assets, I have not uploaded them to the repository. If you wish to extend this work, those assets should be purchased and imported into the Unity project.
