# UnityDrivingSim
A driving simulator created for Self Driving Car research

This repository contains code for a simulator which is being created for the purpose of collecting data for the training of deep neural networks which can be applied to autonomous vehicles.

This work follows from Christopher Hay (Princeton '17) in his paper Training of Vehicle Perception via Stochastic Simulation. 
My work is being conducted under Professor Kornhauser.
